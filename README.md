# clarity
Clarity is a simple dashboard-like application designed to help users manage their todos and notes, with the added functionality of reminders. It provides both a web interface and a CLI for flexibility. The app uses React for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, SQLite for lightweight data storage, and integrates scheduling for reminders.
